- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For the Cafe class, I overloaded sellCoffee so that you can buy a coffee with no sugar or no cream and the necessary cup and coffee is still subtracted from the inventory. For the House class, I overloaded moveIn and moveOut so that a student can be added and removed from a house with an ID number, rather than a name. I overloaded addTitle and removeTitle in the Library class so that if the method is called without a title being specificed, the program tells the user to enter a title.
