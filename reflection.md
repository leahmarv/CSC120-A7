Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For the Cafe class, I overloaded sellCoffee so that you can buy a coffee with no sugar or no cream and the necessary cup and coffee is still subtracted from the inventory. For the House class, I overloaded moveIn and moveOut so that a student can be added and removed from a house with an ID number, rather than a name. I overloaded addTitle and removeTitle in the Library class so that if the method is called without a title being specificed, the program tells the user to enter a title.

I copied over the Cafe, House, and Library classes to the A7 repository, rather than updating the A6 repository. I found this easier for file management. When I was writing my overloaded methods, I went in order by class, which made it easier to keep track of the number of methods I was adding and ensure that I was adding them to the right class. I would tell someone taking this course in the future to make sure that they understand which files from A6 they should copy over to this assignment.
